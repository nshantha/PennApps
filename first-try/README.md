## Current Progress
1. add one map into the website
2. find the address of one point
3. drag the marker and show the position in Infowindow
4. add autocomplete box to search 

## Problems
1. Can't separate the Map components inside the class out of the App
   ( I create one file called MapView.js in mapview/ but it doesn't work )
2. Can't merge others heatmap component into my code
3. Fail to change the position of search box
